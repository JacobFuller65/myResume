            <h3>Bachelor of Business Administration in Computer Science</h3>
            <h4>Oklahoma Baptist University, Shawnee, Oklahoma</h4>
            <p>This program provided a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, data structures, and artificial intelligence. 
                Key projects included building a web application and contributing to an open-source machine learning project. 
                I was able to work in real time with software engineers from the FAA to contribute to an ongoing program that they were working on. 
                I was able to experience and work through a real software developement team and make a meaningful impact on the project.<br><br>
            
                In addition, I was a part of multiple business simulations, through my Business Administration courses.
                One of our project was to create a product that we had to manufacture, develop, market and sell. My group developed hats, t-shirts, hoodies and jackets.
