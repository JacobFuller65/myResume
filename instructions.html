    <h1>Instructions for Wordle Game: </h1>
    <p id="inst-text">
        Wordle is a word game in which players must create words from a set of given letters. To play Wordle, you will need to follow these steps:<br>
        Open the Wordle website in a web browser.<br>
        On the homepage, click the "Play Now" button to start a new game.<br>
        You will be presented with a set of letters, which you must use to form words. The longer the word, the higher the score you will receive.<br>
        To select a letter, click on it. The letter will be highlighted in blue. To deselect a letter, click on it again.<br>
        To submit a word, click on the "Submit" button. If the word is valid, it will be added to your list of words and your score will be updated.<br>
        The game is over when you have used all of the letters or when you have reached the maximum number of words allowed. Your final score will be displayed on the screen.<br>
        Remember to check the game's rules and scoring system to maximize your score. Good luck!<br><br>
