    <h1>Instructions for Wordle Game: </h1>
    <p id="inst-text">
        Wordle is a word game in which players must create words from a set of given letters. To play Wordle, you will need to follow these steps:<br>

        You will be presented with a set of letters, which you will use to form words. <br>
        To make a guess, type all 5 letters, and press the enter button or the enter key on the keyboard.<br>
        The colors work as follows: <br>

        <span id="grey">Grey</span> = Letter is not in the word<br>
        <span id="yellow">Yellow</span> = Letter is in the word, just not in this spot<br>
        <span id="green">Green</span> = Letter in in the correct spot in the word.<br>
        You will have 6 guesses to form the correct word and win the game!<br>

        Good luck!<br><br>
